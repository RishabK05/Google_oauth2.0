# Google_oauth2.0
Google auth2.0

The code you provided is an example of a Node.js application using the Express framework to handle HTTP requests. 
It demonstrates the OAuth2 authorization flow to retrieve a user's authorized third-party applications from the Google Drive API and display the list of apps on a web page.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import express and axios 

Create an instance of the Express application.

Define the OAuth2 parameters in a .env file:

clientId: Your client ID obtained from the Google API Console.
clientSecret: Your client secret obtained from the Google API Console.
redirectUrl: The URL to redirect to after the OAuth2 authorization process.
Construct the authorization URL using the OAuth2 parameters. This URL will be used to redirect the user to the Google OAuth2 authorization page.


Set up a route to handle the OAuth2 callback URL ("/auth/callback"). This route is called by Google after the user grants permission. It retrieves the authorization code from the query parameters.

Inside the callback route, exchange the authorization code for an access token by sending a POST request to the Google token endpoint (https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token). The access token is used to authenticate subsequent requests to the Google Drive API.

Make a GET request to https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/apps using Axios. Include the access token in the request headers to authorize the request.

Set the view engine to "ejs" using app.set('view engine', 'ejs'). This configuration allows rendering of EJS templates.

Start the Express application and listen on port 3000.

Please note that you need to replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' and 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' with your actual Google API client ID and client secret obtained from the Google API Console. Additionally, make sure you have the EJS view engine installed (npm install ejs) and an "index.ejs" file in your views directory (as explained in a previous response) to properly render the app list on the web page.
